AI, especially Generative AI, is reshaping financial services, enhancing products, client interactions, and productivity. However, challenges like hallucinations and model unpredictability make safe deployment complex. Rapid advancements require flexible governance.

Financial institutions are eager to adopt AI but face regulatory hurdles. Existing frameworks may not address AI's unique risks, necessitating an adaptive governance model for safe and compliant integration.

The following framework has been developed by [FINOS (Fintech Open Source Foundation)](https://www.finos.org/) members, providing a comprehensive catalogue of risks and associated mitigations. We suggest using our [heuristic risk identification framework](heuristic-assessment.html) to determine which risks are most relevant for a given use case.
