## Purpose

**Tool Chain Validation and Sanitization** implements comprehensive validation mechanisms for agent tool selection decisions, API parameter sanitization, and safe tool execution sequences. This preventive control ensures that agents cannot be manipulated into selecting inappropriate tools, injecting malicious parameters into API calls, or executing dangerous tool combinations that could result in unauthorized actions or system compromise.

This mitigation addresses the unique attack surface created by agentic systems' autonomous tool selection and execution capabilities, extending beyond traditional input validation to cover the complex decision-making processes that determine which tools agents use and how they sequence multiple tool calls.

## Key Principles

Effective tool chain validation requires comprehensive coverage of agent decision-making and execution processes:

* **Tool Selection Validation**: Verify that agent tool selection decisions are appropriate for the given task, context, and user authorization level.
* **API Parameter Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all parameters passed to APIs through agent tool calls to prevent injection attacks and ensure compliance with business rules.
* **Tool Sequence Safety**: Ensure that combinations and sequences of tool calls follow safe patterns and don't create dangerous or unauthorized workflows.
* **Context Preservation**: Maintain proper context isolation between tool calls to prevent cross-contamination and state corruption.
* **Decision Audit Trails**: Capture comprehensive information about tool selection reasoning and execution for security analysis and regulatory compliance.
* **Real-time Validation**: Implement validation at execution time to catch dynamic attacks that static analysis might miss.

## Implementation Guidance

### 1. Tool Selection Validation Framework

* **Tool Appropriateness Validation**:
  * **Task-Tool Mapping**: Maintain whitelists of appropriate tools for specific task categories (e.g., account inquiry should only use read-only customer data APIs).
  * **Context Validation**: Verify that selected tools are appropriate for the current context, customer type, and business scenario.
  * **Authorization Level Checks**: Ensure selected tools don't exceed the agent's or user's authorization level for the current transaction.

* **Tool Selection Reasoning Capture**:
  * **Decision Logging**: Log the agent's reasoning for tool selection decisions, including input factors and decision criteria.
  * **Alternative Analysis**: When possible, capture why other available tools were not selected to identify potential manipulation.
  * **Confidence Scoring**: Implement confidence metrics for tool selection decisions to identify potentially compromised selections.
  * **Continuous Telemetry**: Note that this approach requires continuous telemetry on agent tool use, which supports ongoing evaluation, benchmarking, and security monitoring. Organizations should establish clear data retention policies and privacy controls for this telemetry data.

* **Dynamic Tool Selection Validation**:
  * **Real-time Validation**: Validate tool selections at execution time rather than relying solely on pre-configured rules.
  * **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**: Compare current tool selections against historical patterns to identify anomalous behavior.
  * **Context-Aware Validation**: Implement validation rules that consider customer sensitivity, transaction value, and risk level.

### 2. API Parameter Validation and Sanitization

* **Parameter Schema Validation**:
  * **Data Type Validation**: Ensure all API parameters conform to expected data types, formats, and ranges.
  * **Business Rule Validation**: Validate parameters against business rules such as transaction limits, account restrictions, and regulatory requirements.
  * **Parameter Relationship Validation**: Check that parameter combinations make business sense and don't violate logical constraints.

* **Input Sanitization Techniques**:
  * **Parameter Whitelisting**: Implement whitelists of acceptable parameter values for high-risk APIs, especially for account identifiers, amounts, and authorization codes.
  * **Format Validation**: Use regular expressions and format validators to ensure parameters conform to expected patterns.
  * **Range Validation**: Implement minimum and maximum value checks for numeric parameters such as transaction amounts and account numbers.

* **Injection Attack Prevention**:
  * **SQL Injection Protection**: Sanitize parameters that will be used in database queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
  * **Command Injection Prevention**: Validate parameters that might be passed to system commands or external processes.
  * **Code Injection Prevention**: Sanitize parameters that might be interpreted as code in downstream systems.

### 3. Tool Sequence and Workflow Validation

* **Safe Tool Chain Patterns**:
  * **Workflow Templates**: Define approved tool chain templates for common business processes and validate against these patterns.
  * **Sequence Validation**: Implement rules for safe tool execution sequences, preventing dangerous combinations such as data gathering followed by unauthorized actions.
  * **State Machine Validation**: Use state machines to validate that tool chains follow approved business process workflows.

* **Dangerous Tool Combination Prevention**:
  * **Tool Incompatibility Rules**: Define and enforce rules about tools that should not be used together or in certain sequences.
  * **Cross-Tool Parameter Validation**: Validate that outputs from one tool are properly sanitized before being used as inputs to subsequent tools.
  * **Tool Chain Break Points**: Implement break points in tool chains where human approval is required before proceeding.

* **Approval and Authorization Workflow Enforcement**:
  * **Multi-Step Validation**: For complex workflows, implement validation at each step rather than just at the beginning.
  * **Human-in-the-Loop Requirements**: Enforce human approval requirements for high-risk tool combinations or parameter values.
  * **Segregation of Duties**: Ensure tool chains respect segregation of duties requirements by preventing single agents from completing entire high-risk processes.

### 4. Real-time Monitoring and Alerting

* **Tool Usage Anomaly Detection**:
  * **Baseline Behavior Modeling**: Establish baselines for normal tool usage patterns and alert on significant deviations.
  * **Unusual Tool Combinations**: Alert on tool combinations that are rarely used together or represent potential security risks.
  * **Parameter Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual parameter values or combinations that might indicate attempted exploitation.

* **Security Event Generation**:
  * **Validation Failure Alerts**: Generate security alerts for tool selection or parameter validation failures.
  * **Repeated Validation Failures**: Escalate alerts when agents repeatedly attempt to use unauthorized tools or invalid parameters.
  * **Tool Chain Manipulation Indicators**: Alert on patterns that suggest tool chain manipulation attacks.

* **Integration with Security Operations**:
  * **SIEM Integration**: Feed tool validation events into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for correlation analysis.
  * **Incident Response Integration**: Provide detailed tool chain information to incident response teams for security investigations.

### 5. Validation Rule Management and Updates

* **Rule Configuration Management**:
  * **Centralized Rule Management**: Maintain validation rules in centralized configuration systems that can be updated across all agents.
  * **Version Control**: Implement version control for validation rules to track changes and enable rollback if needed.
  * **Rule Testing**: Test validation rule changes in non-production environments before deployment.

* **Dynamic Rule Updates**:
  * **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Update validation rules based on emerging threat intelligence and attack patterns.
  * **Business Process Changes**: Update tool chain validation rules when business processes or approval workflows change.
  * **Regulatory Updates**: Incorporate new regulatory requirements into validation rules promptly.

* **Rule Effectiveness Monitoring**:
  * **False Positive Analysis**: Monitor and reduce false positive validation failures that might impact legitimate agent operations.
  * **Coverage Assessment**: Regularly assess validation rule coverage to identify gaps or areas needing additional protection.
  * **Performance Impact**: Monitor the performance impact of validation processes and optimize where necessary.

### 6. Integration with Agent Architecture

* **Tool Manager Integration**:
*For a definition of what a Tool Manager is, please see mi-18, Agent Authority Least Privilege Framework, section 3*
  * **Pre-execution Validation**: Implement validation checks at the tool manager level before any tool execution begins.
  * **Parameter Interception**: Intercept and validate all parameters before they are passed to underlying APIs or systems.
  * **Tool Chain Orchestration**: Use the tool manager to orchestrate safe tool execution sequences and enforce workflow validation.

* **API Gateway Integration**:
  * **Gateway-level Validation**: Implement additional validation at API gateways to provide defense-in-depth.
  * **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Use validation results to inform rate limiting and throttling decisions.
  * **Cross-API Correlation**: Correlate tool usage across multiple APIs to identify potentially malicious patterns.

## Challenges and Considerations

* **Performance Impact**: Comprehensive validation may introduce latency in agent operations, requiring optimization for performance-critical scenarios.
* **False Positive Management**: Overly strict validation rules may block legitimate agent operations, requiring careful tuning.
* **Rule Complexity**: Managing complex validation rules across multiple tool types and business scenarios requires sophisticated rule engines.
* **Dynamic Attack Evolution**: Attackers may develop new tool chain manipulation techniques requiring continuous validation rule updates.
