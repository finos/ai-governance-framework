## Purpose

This control establishes the requirement for a **comprehensive and timely alerting framework for AI systems.** The framework is designed to promptly notify relevant personnel about critical system events, including operational issues, performance degradation, potential security incidents, and with a specific emphasis, **anomalies in resource consumption or financial expenditure (often termed "Denial of Wallet" - DoW, or Spend Alerts).** The primary goal is to enable rapid detection, investigation, and response to such events, thereby maintaining system stability, security, operational integrity, and cost-effectiveness for AI initiatives within the financial institution.

## Key Principles and Strategies for AI System Alerting

An effective alerting strategy for AI systems should be built upon the following principles:

* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Alerting mechanisms should span security events, operational health metrics, AI model performance indicators, resource utilization, and financial spend patterns.
* **Risk-Based Prioritization:** Configure alert severity levels (e.g., critical, high, medium, low) and notification urgency based on the potential impact of the triggering event on business operations, security posture, regulatory compliance, or financial budgets.
* **Actionability and Context:** Alerts must provide sufficient, clear, and concise information (context) to enable recipients to quickly understand the nature of the issue and initiate an appropriate and effective response.
* **Timeliness:** For critical events, particularly those related to security breaches, system outages, or rapid financial overruns, alerts should be generated and delivered in real-time or near real-time to minimize detection and response delays.
* **Tiered and Scoped Alerting:** Implement different levels of alerting tailored to various scopes (e.g., enterprise-wide, specific billing accounts, individual projects, or even user sessions) and granularities of control.
* **Minimizing Alert Fatigue:** Carefully tune alert thresholds, correlation rules, and de-duplication logic to reduce the volume of false positives and non-actionable alerts. Persistent alert fatigue can lead to genuine critical alerts being overlooked.
* **Integration with Incident Management:** Alerts should seamlessly integrate with the institution's existing incident response and management processes, including automated ticket creation where appropriate.
* **Continuous Improvement Cycle:** Regularly review the effectiveness of existing alerts, their thresholds, and notification procedures. Adjust and refine them based on operational experience, evolving AI system behaviors, new risk assessments, and changing business needs.

## Implementation Guidance

Implementing a robust alerting framework for AI systems involves defining requirements, configuring diverse alert types, establishing appropriate mechanisms, and planning response procedures:

### 1. Define Alerting Requirements and Thresholds
* **Collaborative Definition:** Work closely with AI development teams, MLOps engineers, FinOps analysts, information security teams, risk managers, and relevant business stakeholders to identify key events, conditions, and metrics that warrant alerting.
* **Baseline Establishment:** Establish normal operational baselines for AI system performance, resource usage patterns, and typical costs. This should be informed by documented resource requirements (as per ISO 42001 A.4.2) and historical operational data. Alerting thresholds should then be set relative to these established baselines to detect meaningful deviations.
* **Risk-Informed Thresholds:** Utilize risk assessments to determine critical alert points. For example, define what specific level of unexpected spend constitutes a significant Denial of Wallet risk, or what degree of performance degradation becomes unacceptable for a given AI service.

### 2. Configure Diverse Alert Types for AI Systems

#### A. Operational Health and Performance Alerts (as per ISO 42001 A.6.2.6)
* **System/Component Availability:** Alerts for AI model API endpoint unresponsiveness, failures in critical microservices, or data pipeline interruptions.
* **Error Rates:** Notifications for significant increases in API error percentages, model prediction errors, or data processing failures.
* **Processing Queues & Latency:** Alerts for excessive processing queue lengths, unacceptable wait times, or model inference/response latency exceeding defined SLAs.
* **Model Performance Degradation:** Notifications for detected drift in model accuracy, fairness metrics, or other key performance indicators beyond acceptable ranges.

#### B. Security Alerts
* **Threat Detection:** Alerts for detected intrusions, unauthorized access attempts to AI models or data, or malware affecting AI infrastructure.
* **Policy Violations:** Notifications for violations of security policies, such as anomalous data access patterns, or alerts from specialized AI security tools (e.g., AI Firewall for prompt injection attempts, DLP systems for potential data exfiltration).
* **Anomalous API Usage:** Alerts for unusual patterns in API calls that might indicate abuse, compromised credentials, or reconnaissance activity.

#### C. Resource Consumption and Financial Spend Alerts (Denial of Wallet Prevention)
A layered approach to spend alerting and control provides robust protection against Denial of Wallet scenarios:

* **Layer 0: Enterprise-Wide Hard Spending Caps**
    * **Control:** Implement absolute, non-negotiable spending limits at the highest organizational level or directly with payment providers (e.g., credit card limits for specific services).
    * **Mechanism:** Typically configured and enforced by central accounting/controlling departments or via payment provider settings.
    * **Pros:** Provides a definitive "stop-loss" to prevent catastrophic, unbounded overspending; often requires no custom code.
    * **Cons:** A very blunt instrument. If limits are hit (due to mis-sizing, genuine unexpected peak demand, or abuse), it can cause an abrupt, widespread service outage. Requires extremely careful planning and regular review.
* **Layer 1: Real-Time Budget Alerts from Infrastructure Providers**
    * **Control:** Configure real-time or near real-time budget alerts directly within the AI model hosting infrastructure or cloud hyperscaler platforms (e.g., AWS Budgets, Azure Cost Management & Billing, Google Cloud Billing Budgets).
    * **Mechanism:** Set thresholds that trigger notifications (email, SMS, etc.) when actual or forecasted spend approaches or exceeds predefined budget amounts for specific accounts, services, or projects.
    * **Pros:** Relatively easy and quick to set up (often just a few minutes); low operational friction to implement basic notifications.
    * **Cons:** Primarily reactive (notifies after spend has occurred or is projected); can contribute to alert fatigue if thresholds are too sensitive or numerous; relies on the timeliness and granularity of the provider's billing data.
* **Layer 2: Periodic Spend Limits and Monitoring by FinOps/Finance**
    * **Control:** Establish daily, weekly, or monthly spend limits that are aligned with departmental budgets, specific AI projects, or billing accounts.
    * **Mechanism:** Monitored by FinOps or finance teams, often through review of billing dashboards and reports. May involve manual checks against Purchase Orders (POs) or General Ledger (GL) codes.
    * **Pros:** Aligns AI operational spend with established financial governance processes and reporting structures.
    * **Cons:** Typically offers coarse-grained control; manual monitoring and intervention can be slow to react to rapid, short-term overruns; less effective for preventing immediate DoW.
* **Layer 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Quota Policies**
    * **Control:** Define and enforce resource usage or spend quotas directly within Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations (e.g., using Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation, Bicep). Example: `quota <= $X/day` for resources deployed for a specific AI project or environment.
    * **Mechanism:** Quotas are declaratively defined as part of the infrastructure provisioning scripts.
    * **Pros:** Proactive rather than reactive; resource limits are auditable and version-controlled alongside infrastructure code; helps enforce cost discipline from the design phase.
    * **Cons:** Requires mature IaC development and deployment practices; may not cover all types of dynamic spend effectively (e.g., per-token costs from a third-party SaaS LLM API which are not directly provisioned via IaC).
* **Layer 4: Granular API Key/Team-Level Quotas and Rate Limiting**
    * **Control:** Implement token usage quotas (e.g., max tokens per day/month), request rate limits (requests per second/minute), and potentially cost-based quotas at a fine-grained level, such as per individual API key, user account, team, or client application.
    * **Mechanism:** Typically enforced via a central API Gateway, a custom-built proxy middleware, or through built-in capabilities of the AI service platform itself.
    * **Pros:** Offers very fine-grained control; enables charge-back or show-back models for AI resource consumption; can quickly isolate and throttle abusive, runaway, or inefficient consumers.
    * **Cons:** Can require custom code development and ongoing state management for the gateway/proxy; adds a layer of complexity to the architecture.
* **Layer 5: Adaptive and Semantic Rate Limiting (Advanced/Experimental)**
    * **Control:** Implement dynamic rate-limiting or request prioritization that adapts based on real-time conditions or the semantic content/complexity of AI requests. For LLMs, this could involve analyzing prompt complexity or enforcing semantic policies. For general ML, it might involve adjusting limits based on a combination of factors like a user's risk score and their current spend velocity.
    * **Mechanism:** Requires sophisticated monitoring, analysis (potentially using ML itself to assess request risk/cost), and control logic.
    * **Pros:** Can enable more graceful degradation of service under load; potentially more effective at stopping subtle misuse or complex resource abuse patterns quickly compared to static quotas.
    * **Cons:** Often experimental and significantly more complex to design, implement, and maintain; needs careful baseline establishment, ongoing ML model tuning (if used), and carries a higher risk of false positives or negatives if not precisely calibrated.

### 3. Establish Alerting Mechanisms and Tooling
* **Integration with Observability:** Ensure alerting systems are tightly integrated with the comprehensive monitoring and logging infrastructure established for AI systems (as per control AIR-DET-004 System Observability).
* **Centralized Alerting Platform:** Utilize a centralized alerting platform where feasible to manage alert rules, define severity levels, configure notification policies, and track alert lifecycle consistently across different AI services.
* **Diverse Notification Channels:** Configure appropriate notification channels based on alert severity and target audience (e.g., email for low-priority, SMS/PagerDuty for critical, Slack/Microsoft Teams integrations for team awareness, automated ticket creation in ITSM systems).

### 4. Define Alert Response and Escalation Procedures
* **Incident Response Playbooks:** Develop and maintain documented incident response playbooks for different categories and severities of critical alerts, especially for Denial of Wallet / significant spend anomalies, major operational outages, and confirmed security incidents.
* **Roles and Responsibilities:** Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of different teams (e.g., MLOps, SRE, FinOps, Security Operations, application owners) for acknowledging, investigating, and remediating issues triggered by alerts.
* **Escalation Paths:** Establish clear and well-understood escalation paths for unresolved issues or for alerts that indicate a severe or widespread impact, ensuring timely engagement of senior management or specialized teams when necessary.

## Importance and Benefits

A well-implemented AI system alerting framework, including specific Denial of Wallet / spend alerts, provides numerous crucial benefits:

* **Proactive Risk Mitigation:** Enables early detection of operational issues, emerging security threats, and potential financial overruns, allowing for timely intervention before these escalate into significant incidents or losses.
* **Critical Financial Control (Denial of Wallet Prevention):**  Specifically addresses the significant financial risk of uncontrolled or unexpected AI resource consumption, protecting the institution from surprise large bills and helping to ensure AI initiatives remain within allocated budgets (directly supports mitigation of `ri-7` by preventing service suspension due to budget exhaustion).
* **Enhanced System Availability and Reliability:**  Helps maintain the availability, stability, and performance of critical AI systems by quickly identifying and facilitating the resolution of factors (e.g., resource bottlenecks, component failures, excessive load) that could lead to service outages or degradation.
* **Improved Security Posture:**  Provides timely warnings of potential security incidents (e.g., anomalous access, abuse of resources, outputs from compromised models), supporting a faster and more effective security response and investigation.
* **Increased Operational Efficiency:**  Automates the continuous monitoring of critical conditions, freeing up valuable personnel from constant manual checks and allowing them to focus their efforts on responding to validated issues and strategic improvements.
* **Support for SLAs and Performance Targets:**  Helps ensure that AI services are consistently meeting their defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and performance objectives by alerting on deviations.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making and Optimization:**  Alerting data, when aggregated and analyzed over time, can provide valuable insights into system trends, peak load patterns, resource provisioning needs, and specific areas ripe for optimization or cost-saving.
* **Accountability and Governance:**  Provides auditable evidence of monitoring and control over AI system operations and expenditures, supporting internal governance and potentially external compliance requirements.
