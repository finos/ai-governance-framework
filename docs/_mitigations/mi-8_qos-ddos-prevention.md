## Purpose

The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into financial applications, particularly through Generative AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Agentic workflows, introduces significant operational risks. These include potential disruptions in service availability, degradation of performance, and inequities in service delivery. This control addresses the critical need to **ensure Quality of Service (QoS) and implement robust Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) prevention measures** for AI systems.

AI systems, especially those exposed via APIs or public interfaces, are susceptible to various attacks that can impact QoS. These include volumetric attacks (overwhelming the system with traffic), prompt flooding (sending a high volume of complex queries), and inference spam (repeated, resource-intensive model calls). Such activities can exhaust computational resources, induce unacceptable latency, or deny legitimate users access to critical AI-driven services. This control aims to maintain system resilience, ensure fair access, and protect against malicious attempts to disrupt AI operations.

## Core Objectives and Principles

The primary objectives of implementing QoS and DDoS prevention for AI systems are to:

* **Maintain Availability:** Ensure AI systems remain accessible to legitimate users and dependent processes by preventing resource exhaustion from high-volume, abusive, or malicious requests.
* **Ensure Predictable Performance:** Maintain consistent and acceptable performance levels (e.g., response times, throughput) even under varying loads.
* **Detect and Mitigate Malicious Traffic:** Identify and neutralize adversarial traffic patterns specifically targeting AI infrastructure, including those exploiting the unique characteristics of AI workloads.
* **Fair Resource Allocation:** Implement mechanisms to prioritize access and allocate resources effectively, especially during periods of congestion, based on user roles, service tiers, or business-critical workflows.

Key principles underpinning these objectives include:

* **Defense in Depth:** Employing multiple layers of security controls at the network, application, and AI model interface levels.
* **Proactive Resource Management:** Ensuring adequate system and computing resources are planned for and dynamically managed (as per ISO 42001 A.4.5).
* **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:** Actively monitoring system performance and traffic for anomalies to enable rapid response and adaptation of protective measures (as per ISO 42001 A.6.2.6).

## Implementation Guidance

To effectively ensure QoS and protect AI systems from DDoS attacks, consider the following implementation measures:

### 1. Traffic Management and Control
* **Rate Limiting:**
    * **Action:** Enforce request quotas per user, API key, IP address, or other identifiable entities.
    * **Purpose:** Prevents abuse, resource monopolization by a single entity, and mitigates brute-force attacks on AI system resources.
* **Traffic Shaping and Throttling:**
    * **Action:** Implement dynamic throttling mechanisms to manage bursts of traffic and smooth out system load, preventing sudden spikes from overwhelming resources.
    * **Purpose:** Maintains system stability and predictable performance during high-demand periods.

### 2. Traffic Filtering and Input Validation
* **Anomaly Detection:**
    * **Action:** Employ systems (potentially ML-based) to identify unusual traffic patterns, deviations from normal request structures, or other indicators of DDoS activity or abuse.
    * **Purpose:** Enables early detection of sophisticated or low-and-slow attacks that might evade simpler thresholds.
* **Rigorous Input Validation:**
    * **Action:** Enforce strict validation of all incoming data (e.g., API requests, prompts, file uploads) to filter out malformed, excessively large, or computationally resource-intensive inputs before they reach the AI model.
    * **Purpose:** Prevents exploits that leverage malformed inputs to consume resources or cause system instability.

### 3. Infrastructure Resilience
* **Load Balancing:**
    * **Action:** Use dynamic load balancers to distribute incoming traffic intelligently across multiple AI model instances, compute nodes, and availability zones.
    * **Purpose:** Prevents localized overloads, improves overall throughput, and enhances fault tolerance.
* **Redundancy and Failover:**
    * **Action:** Design and implement redundant infrastructure components (e.g., model instances, databases, API gateways) with automated failover mechanisms.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures service continuity and maximum uptime during high-load scenarios, component failures, or targeted attacks.
* **Edge Protection:**
    * **Action:** Integrate with network-level DDoS protection services provided by CDNs or specialized security vendors.
    * **Purpose:** Absorbs and filters large-scale volumetric attacks at the network edge before they reach the institution's core AI infrastructure.

### 4. Resource Allocation and Prioritization
* **Prioritization Policies (QoS Tiers):**
    * **Action:** Implement QoS tiers or policies to prioritize requests from critical operations, specific user groups, or higher-value service tiers, especially during periods of network or system congestion.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures that essential AI-driven functions remain operational even when under duress.
* **Resource Isolation:**
    * **Action:** Utilize techniques like containerization or microservices architecture to isolate different AI system components (e.g., data ingestion, model inference, supporting databases).
    * **Purpose:** Prevents an overload or failure in one component (e.g., an upstream data processing service) from cascading and impacting the core AI inference or decision-making systems.

### 5. Monitoring, Alerting, and Response
* **Real-time Monitoring:**
    * **Action:** Continuously track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as latency, error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU), and traffic volumes.
    * **Purpose:** Provides visibility into system health and early warning of potential QoS issues or attacks.
* **Anomaly Detection Systems:**
    * **Action:** Leverage monitoring tools, potentially augmented with machine learning, to automatically detect anomalous patterns indicative of emerging DDoS attacks (including "low-and-slow" attacks) or prompt-based abuse.
    * **Purpose:** Enables faster identification of threats that may not trigger simple threshold-based alerts.
* **Incident Response Plan:**
    * **Action:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for AI-related QoS degradation and DDoS attacks, outlining steps for mitigation, escalation, and communication.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures a swift and coordinated response to minimize impact.

### Reference Implementation: API Gateway for AI Services
A common and effective approach for managing access to AI services (especially LLMs) involves deploying an API gateway. This gateway acts as a central enforcement point for many QoS and security policies:
* **API Key Management:** Generate unique API keys for different applications, users, or use cases.
    1.  **Granular Access Control & Revocation:** Allows for the immediate revocation of keys associated with misbehaving or compromised applications/users without impacting others.
    2.  **Usage Attribution & Cost Management:** Enables tracking of AI resource consumption at a granular level (per use case or department). This supports accurate cost allocation, helps measure ROI, and can identify unexpectedly high usage that might indicate abuse or a "Denial of Wallet" scenario.
    3.  **Request Prioritization:** The gateway can be configured to prioritize requests based on API key characteristics (e.g., service tier), ensuring that critical applications maintain access to AI resources even when capacity is constrained and SLAs for all consumers cannot be met simultaneously.
* **Integrated Policies:** The API gateway can enforce rate limiting, request/response validation, and potentially integrate with other security services.

## Additional Consideration: Prompt Filtering/Firewall for AI Models

While traditional DDoS measures focus on network and application layers, AI models (especially LLMs) face unique threats through malicious prompts (e.g., prompt injection, complex queries designed to exhaust resources).
* **Limitations of Static Filters:** Simple, static filters (e.g., keyword blocking) are often insufficient against evolving prompt injection techniques or cleverly crafted resource-intensive queries.
* **Need for Adaptive Approaches:** Dynamic, adaptive filtering mechanisms are necessary. These might include using secondary AI models ("AI firewalls" or "LLM judges") to analyze incoming prompts for malicious intent or resource abuse potential.
* **Layered Defense:** Employ fixed rules as a first-pass filter, but supplement them with adaptive systems that learn from ongoing traffic patterns and threat intelligence. This is part of a broader AI firewall strategy to secure input validation and content filtering at multiple layers.
