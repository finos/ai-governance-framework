### Value Proposition

The *AI Readiness Governance Framework* aims to bridge the gap between the transformative potential of AI and the stringent requirements of the financial services industry. By providing a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with AI systems, the framework empowers organizations to harness AI's benefits while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards and safeguarding against operational risks.

- For *Technical Teams*, the AI Readiness Governance Framework can offer developers a clear set of guidelines and best practices for integrating AI technologies into existing systems. This can improve risk mitigation by identifying potential risks early in the development cycle, promoting robust and secure AI solutions.
- For *CISOs and Risk Management teams*, the AI Readiness Governance Framework can work to establish an early-stage 'toolbox' to evaluate the security implications of AI technologies. This helps to ensure that AI implementations align with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.
- For *Heads of AI and CTO/CIO Offices*, the AI Readiness Governance Framework provides benefit to aligning AI initiatives with the organization's strategic objectives and technological roadmap. In turn, this can improve resource optimization and ROI with respect to investments in AI development/adoption.
- For *Vendors and Service Providers*, the AI Readiness Governance Framework can aide in understanding the governance expectations of financial institutions and build trust with clients by demonstrating adherence with an established framework.

### How is the AIGF different from the ISO or NIST frameworks? (detailed)

1. Financial Services Focus
Unlike ISO and NIST standards, which tend to be broad and cross-industry, the FINOS AI Governance Framework is tailored to the specific regulatory and operational requirements of financial services. Its design reflects real-world challenges faced by banks, fintechs, and other financial institutions (e.g., model risk management, auditability, and compliance in highly regulated environments).

2. Collaborative, Open Source Development
While ISO and NIST frameworks are typically created through more formalized and sometimes slower standards processes, FINOS’s open source approach drives faster, community-driven evolution. Direct contributions from financial institutions, technology providers, and regulators ensure the framework remains both practical and up-to-date with the latest industry needs.

3. Accelerated Implementation and Alignment
FINOS’s rapid release of an initial AI Governance Framework only after 6 months of forming the AI Readiness Group demonstrates an agile, iterative model. In contrast, ISO and NIST standards often require longer timelines for drafting, review, and publication. FINOS can also adapt more quickly to new regulatory requirements or emerging risks in AI.

4. Code and Tooling Integration
FINOS projects frequently include reference implementations, code snippets, and tooling to help organizations operationalize guidelines. While ISO or NIST may provide valuable conceptual frameworks, FINOS will be implementing open source controls and tests in the Common Cloud Controls project to enable easy conformance and compliance. 

5. Financial Service Reglatory Mapping
The framework also differs by providing a regulatory mapping to various regulatory requirements in the Financial Services industry. This help provide a baseline of additional considerations needed for implementing these AI use-cases in the Financial Services Industry

6. Direct Regulator Engagement Within the Community
FINOS open source nature enables active visibility towards and participation from regulators, facilitating alignment with evolving expectations and helping to bridge industry and regulatory perspectives. This fosters mutual trust and ensures the framework is developed with direct regulatory insight, something not always inherent in ISO or NIST processes.
